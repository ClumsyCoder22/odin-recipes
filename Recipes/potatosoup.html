   <h1>Potato Soup</h1>
   
   <img src="/images/Old-Fashioned-Potato-Soup-BFK-10-1-of-1.jpg">

   <p>This old-fashioned potato soup recipe is closest to the soup I remember as a child. I have seen many renditions of it surface in several bistros. It is easy and the method can be applied to broccoli or cauliflower versions as well.</p>

   <ul>
    <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
    <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
    <li>6 potatoes, peeled and diced</li>
    <li>2 carrots, diced</li>
    <li>3 cups of water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chicken bouillon powder</li>
    <li>Ground black powder</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>3 cups milk</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Directions</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Step 1</li>
    <p>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in onion; cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.</p>
    <li>Step 2</li>
    <p>While onions are cooking, place diced potatoes, carrots, water, and chicken bouillon in another pot and bring to a boil. Cook until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Do not overcook. Season with ground black pepper to taste.</p>
    <li>Step 3</li>
    <p>Add flour to cooked onions to make a paste. Cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Gradually add milk and stir well. Cook over low heat stirring constantly until warmed through. Add potato and carrot mixture. Stir in parsley and thyme and heat through. Serve hot.</p>
   </ol>
