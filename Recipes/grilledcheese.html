   <p>Everyone needs a good grilled cheese recipe in their arsenal for when you just want a comfort food! This recipe reminds me of when I was a child and not feeling good! My grandmother would make me this grilled cheese and a bowl of tomato soup and I would almost feel better instantly! Whether you are a chef or a beginner, this recipe will make you feel all warm and fuzzy when it is done!</p>

   <ul>
    <li>4 slices of bread</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
    <li>2 slices Cheddar Cheese</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Directions</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Step 1</li>
    <p>Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Generously butter one side of a slice of bread. Place bread butter-side down in the hot skillet; add 1 slice of cheese. Butter a second slice of bread on one side and place butter-side up on top of cheese.</p>
    <li>Step 2</li>
    <p>Cook until lightly browned on one side; flip over and continue cooking until cheese is melted. Repeat with remaining 2 slices of bread, butter, and slice of cheese.</p>
